## 🔧 BUGS FIXED IN THIS SESSION

### Bug #1: Profile Update Not Working ✅
**Issue:** Clicking "Update Profile" did nothing  
**Root Cause:** Used `login()` instead of `updateUser()`  
**Fix:** Changed to correct function in `handleProfileSubmit`  
**Status:** FIXED

### Bug #2: Export Data Button Not Working ✅
**Issue:** Button had no onClick handler  
**Root Cause:** Missing implementation  
**Fix:** Added `handleExportData()` function with:
- Fetches all user data (profile, records, reminders)
- Creates JSON file
- Downloads with timestamp
**Status:** FIXED

### Bug #3: Delete Account Button Not Working ✅
**Issue:** Button had no onClick handler  
**Root Cause:** Missing implementation & backend endpoint  
**Fix:** 
- Added `handleDeleteAccount()` function
- Created backend endpoint `/api/users/account` (DELETE)

- Deletes all user data (records, reminders, account)
- Logs out and redirects
**Status:** FIXED

### Bug #4: Dashboard Stats Always Show "0" ✅
